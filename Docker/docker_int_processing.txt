- When we run a container then :
    looks for the image in the cache
    then looks in remote docker repo ( defaults hub.docker.com )
    Downloads the latest version of the image
    Create new container based on the image
    Gives it a virtual IP on pvt network inside docker engine

Containers v/s Vms

➤ Containers and virtual machines both have similar resource
allocation and allocation benefits.
➤ Containers and VMs are functionally different because
containers virtualise the Operating System and VMs are
virtualise the hardware.
➤ Containers are more portable

Containers are not VMs
➤ Containers are just processes.
➤ Containers are limited what resources they can access.
➤ Exit when process exits.
