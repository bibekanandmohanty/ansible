➤ Docker containers and services can be connected with each
other.
➤ Containers and Services don’t need to be aware, where they
are deployed.
➤ Container and Services can communicate, Whether your
Docker hosts run Linux, Windows, or a mix of the two.
➤ This all possible because of default drivers in Docker.

➤ Each Container connect to virtual private network called
‘bridge’.
➤ bridge : This is default Network driver of Docker.
➤ All Containers on same bridge can communicate each other
with-out -p (port)
➤ Best Practice to create Networks :
network “sql_php_nwt” for mySQL and PHP Containers
network “mongo_nwt” for mongo and PHP Containers

➤ Docker Network is easy to Plugged-in in Containers.
➤ User is allow to Create Multiple VPN.
➤ Create Multiple Rules for Single Network.
➤ Attach Multiple Containers to One Network, and Attach
single container to more than One Network or no need to
attach any network to container.

➤ Show All networks
docker network ls
➤ Lists all the networks the Engine daemon knows about.
➤ We can filter the Networks
To Filter all bridge network
docker network ls -f drive=bridge
➤ To find all Network IDs and Drivers
docker network ls --format "{{.ID}}: {{.Driver}}

➤ Inspect any Network
docker network inspect

➤ Returns information about one or more networks. By default,
this command renders all results in a JSON object.

➤ Create New Network on Host Machine
docker network create
➤ Above command creates ‘bridge’ network by default.
➤ Create a bridge network
docker network create -d bridge my-bridge-network

➤ Connect Network with Container
docker network connect network1 container1
➤ Connects a container to a network. You can connect a
container by name or by ID.
➤ After connection, the container can communicate with other
containers in the same network.
